  <h2 class="post-title">Simulator Independent</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">9ML does not include solver-specific details and therefore can be implemented on a wide range of simulator platforms</p>
</div><!-- /.tile -->

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Modular</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Components representing membrane dynamics, ion pools, synapses, connectivity patterns, cell layouts, etc.. are created from custom templates (classes) and connected together to quickly prototype models of neurons/networks</p>
</div><!-- /.tile -->

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Low-level</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Component classes are described by mathematical expressions, which receive input via ports. This generic approach provides a highly flexible framework for simulating arbitrary neuron models and a direct mapping to many simulator architectures</p>
</div><!-- /.tile -->

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Extensible</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">...kind of covered this in the last two points...</p>
