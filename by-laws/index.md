  a. promote the use and further expansion of the NineML language  
  b. maintain and update the specifications of the NineML language, this includes considering proposals for expanding the   specifications  
  c. interact with other organizations that are interested in model description languages  
    [Note: 1b is the primary task of this committee, in the future 1a or 1c may be taken over by other NineML committees]

1. The committee has a chair who is elected for two years by a simple majority of its active members. The chair can be replaced if a majority of active members decides so. The chair makes sure that the committee performs its tasks in an orderly manner and is responsible for calling meetings and organizing a vote. The chair is also the official contact person for the committee.
1. The committee tries to achieve consensus for its decisions. In case no consensus can be reached a vote will be taken.

The committee tries to achieve an initial recommendation on a proposal within 2 months of submission.
1. Most committee business, including voting, is conducted using electronic communication. Members are expected to respond within one week to e-mails unless they announced a prolonged absence. In the case of voting a lack of response within two weeks is considered an abstain. The records of the electronic communication are the minutes of the committee.
