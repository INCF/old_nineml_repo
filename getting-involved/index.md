There are several different ways you can contribute to the 9ML community.

## Contribute to the mailing list

Want to use NineML but do not know how to do it? Need more information about the use of the APIs, have questions regarding 9ML, join the [9ML mailing list](http://lists.incf.org/mailman/listinfo/nineml-users) and ask a question.

Don't be shy, each answered question improves the understanding within the community and may highlight areas for further development.

## Raise an issue on the GitHub tracker

Find a problem with the specification or want to suggest an enhancement? Please file an issue in the [9ML issue tracker](https://github.com/INCF/nineml/issues). But before you do please search through the existing issues to see whether a similar issue has already been raised.


## Writing component classes

If you write a new abstraction layer component class that you think will be of wider interest please create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to add your component classes to the catalog [https://github.com/INCF/nineml/tree/master/catalog](https://github.com/INCF/nineml/tree/master/catalog).

## Writing extensions

An extensions framework is planned for 9ML v2.0, which will allow the definition of richer syntax for abstraction layer components, such as multi-component/compartmental neuron models and molecular kinetics. Space will be made available in the official GitHub repository for extensions contributed by the community.

Stay tuned for developments on this front...


## Joining the committee

The 9ML Standards Committee accepts applications, however, numbers on the committee are limited and each application needs to be approved by at least 2/3 of the committee (see [by-laws](http://nineml.net/by-laws/)). Please send any inquiries to the committee chair [Erik De Schutter (erik@oist.jp)](mailto:erik@oist.jp).
