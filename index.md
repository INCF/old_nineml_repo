  <h2 class="post-title">Simulator Independent</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">9ML doesn't include solver-specific details, only 
  the <i>model</i> to be simulated, and is therefore a suitable language for a wide range of simulators and analysis tools</p>
</div><!-- /.tile -->

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Modular</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt"><i>Components</i> representing membrane dynamics, ion pools, synapses, etc.. are created from custom-made templates and connected together using <i>components</i> representing connectivity patterns, cell layouts, etc.., enabling quick prototyping of neuron/network models</p>
</div><!-- /.tile -->

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Flexible</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Components are described by mathematical <i>expressions</i>, and communicate with each other via <i>ports</i>. This generic approach provides a highly flexible framework for simulating arbitrary neuron/network models</p>
</div><!-- /.tile -->

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Lightweight</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">9ML provides a minimal set of <i>core</i> elements for describing neuron/network simulations in order to present a low barrier for their  implementation. Expressive power is added via <i>extensions</i>, which are required
to map onto the <i>core</i> to guarantee portability between 9ML compliant tools</p>
