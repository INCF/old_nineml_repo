The current 9ML specification, version 1.0, can be downloaded from [here](http://nineml.net/specification/specification.pdf)
or the latex source can be accessed via the GitHub repository [http://github.com/INCF/nineml/](http://github.com/INCF/nineml/).

The corresponding 9ML schema can be downloaded from [here (http://nineml.net/9ML/1.0/NineML_v1.0.xsd)](http://nineml.net/9ML/1.0/NineML_v1.0.xsd). However, note that schema only validates the model hierachy and basic types, not all the requirements of valid 9ML descriptions (which are in the specification).
