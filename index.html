<a name="purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose</h3>

<p>NineML is a simulator independent language with the aim of providing an unambiguous description of neuronal network models for efficient model sharing and reusability.</p>

<p>This language has emerged from a joint effort of experts in the fields of computational neuroscience, simulator development and simulator-independent language initiatives (<a href="http://www.neuroml.org/">NeuroML</a>, <a href="http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/">PyNN</a>), grouped in the <a href="https://www.incf.org/activities/our-programs/modeling/people">INCF Multiscale Modeling Task Force</a>.
This effort was initiated and is still supported by the <a href="http://www.incf.org">International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility</a> (INCF), as part of the standardization effort of the <a href="https://www.incf.org/activities/our-programs/modeling">Multiscale Modeling Program</a>, but the project is now run as a community project, with an elected editorial board.</p>

<h3>

          <p>Bylaws of the NineML Standardization Committee
            <ol>
              <li>The goals of the NineML Standardization Committee are to:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>promote the use and further expansion of the NineML language</li>
                  <li>maintain and update the specifications of the NineML language, this includes considering proposals for expanding the specifications</li>
                  <li>interact with other organizations that are interested in model description languages</li>
                </ol>
                [Note: 1b is the primary task of this committee, in the future 1a or 1c may be taken over by other NineML committees]
              </li>
              <li>The committee has active and corresponding members.  Active members can vote and are expected to work towards achieving the goals of the committee. Corresponding members are kept informed and can be included in important discussions.</li>
              <li>The committee has a chair who is elected for two years by a simple majority of its active members.  The chair can be replaced if a majority of active members decides so.  The chair makes sure that the committee performs its tasks in an orderly manner and is responsible for calling meetings and organizing a vote.  The chair is also the official contact person for the committee.</li>
              <li>The committee tries to achieve consensus for its decisions. In case no consensus can be reached a vote will be taken. For most matters a simple majority of votes will decide; in case of a tie the chair has the tie-breaking vote. For changing the NineML language specifications or inviting new committee members a 2/3 majority of votes is needed.</li>
              <li>The committee can invite additional active members or consider application of new active members. The decision process outlined under #4 applies.</li>
              <li>Any active member can decide to leave the committee by writing the chair about the resignation.</li>
              <li>Anybody can submit proposals to this committee concerning the NineML language. If the proposal is submitted by a non-member the chair will appoint an active member to take on the responsibility of presenting the proposal to the committee. The committee tries to achieve an initial recommendation on a proposal within 2 months of submission.</li>
              <li>Most committee business, including voting, is conducted using electronic communication. Members are expected to respond within one week to e-mails unless they announced a prolonged absence. In the case of voting a lack of response within two weeks is considered an abstain. The records of the electronic communication are the minutes of the committee.</li>
              <li>The committee tries to meet person to person once a year at a date and location which is announced at least 3 months in advance. Such a physical meeting is a valid meeting of the committee if at least 2/3 of members are present. A secretary is appointed who will take minutes.</li>
              <li>The committee ceases to exist if it has less than 3 active members for more than 6 months.</li>
            </ol>
